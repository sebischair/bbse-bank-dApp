## BBSE Bank
BBSEBank is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to earn interest by depositing Ether.
The interest is calculated based on a pre-defined yearly return rate. Although the users can withdraw their Ether back anytime they want, the longer the deposit stays, the more interest they earn. The interest is paid in the form of BBSE token which is an ERC20 token. BBSEBank users can also borrow ETH by collateralizing their BBSE tokens.
